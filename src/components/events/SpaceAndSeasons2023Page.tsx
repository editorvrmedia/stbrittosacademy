        <strong>SPACE:</strong> On April 12, 1961, Yuri Gagarin was launched into orbit by a Vostok rocket and became the first human to journey into outer space. Our solar system consists of our star, the sun, and everything bound to it by gravity. The planets Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune, dwarf planets such as Pluto. Dozens of moons and millions of asteroids, comets and meteoroids.

        The solar system has eight planets. Earth is only a very small part of the solar system. It was formed 4.6 billion years ago. The solar system is part of the Milky Way. The sun is 93 million miles from the earth. All planets and the sun in the solar system are shaped like balls.

        <strong>SEASONS:</strong> The seasons are four different times during the year with different types of weather. The four seasons are called spring, summer, autumn and winter. Seasons change throughout the year because of the way the earth moves. The earth orbits or travels around the sun.

        Space is also known as outer space. It is an area directly outside of the earth's atmosphere. As we launched the first satellites into space, to first get our sea legs in the ether, that knowledge and capability enabled the GDPs constellation, accurate weather forecasting and modern telecommunication. Three technologies our modern-day civilization could not live without.

        Students will be able to identify characteristics of our solar system and human accommodations that enable space exploration. Students will be able to identify different equipment used and conversation about things like the planets, solar system and seasons will engage and nurture their inquisitive minds.
