        Diwali, a widely celebrated festival in India, is also called ‘Deepavali,’ meaning ‘a string of lights.’ Rooted in ancient Hindu mythology, it marks Lord Rama’s return to Ayodhya after defeating Ravana. Believers view it as the triumph of good over evil, with Goddess Lakshmi bringing blessings of wealth and prosperity on Diwali night. The festival symbolizes the victory of light over darkness.
