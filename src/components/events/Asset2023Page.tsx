          ASSET was a two-day event. Knock-out games were held on Day 1 while
          the Quarter-Finals, Semi-Finals, and Finals were held on Day 2. A total
          of 9 different games for both boys & girls, under A division & B
          division, were conducted across the Senior and Super-Senior categories.

          While ASSET was a test of skill and endurance, for the public who had
          gathered there, it was a choice of which game to watch. The greatest
          success of ASSET was that it had a wide reach all over Chennai and
          brought students from all boards—Matriculation, CBSE, and State board—
          on a common platform.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the whole, ASSET was perfectly planned, organised, and executed on
          the lines of its expectations.
